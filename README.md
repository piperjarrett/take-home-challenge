## Learning Goals 
Tasked withing showing:
  - A list of articles
  - A “detailed” view for each article (as opposed to summary/list view)
  - Articles in the list must link to the detailed article view you create
  - Some sort of search, filter, OR sort

## Setup
1. Fork this repo - on the top right corner of this page, click the **Fork** button. 
2. Clone down the forked repo. To rename your project you can use an optional argument when you run git clone (you replace the [...] with the terminal command arguments): `git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]`
3. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` in the terminal to see the page running in your browser on `http://localhost:3000/`. `Control + C` is the command to stop running the local server.  Closing the terminal without stopping the server first could allow the server to continue to run in the background and cause problems. This command is not specific to Webpack; make note of it for future use. 
7. Enjoy!

## Future Additions
- Adding a search that allows users to filter through the title of the articles

## Technologies
This project used React, React Router, and CSS.
